C is a compiled language so it needs the compiler to be installed locally on the system
so that it can process the code to create an executable file that actually runs the code

✅ Step 1: Install GCC (MinGW for Windows)

Go to MinGW-w64 download page

Download the installer (mingw-w64-install.exe).

Run the installer:

Architecture: x86_64

Threads: posix

Exception: seh

Install path: e.g. C:\mingw-w64

✅ Step 2: Add GCC to PATH

Open Start menu → type "environment variables" → Edit the system environment variables.

In the System Properties window → click Environment Variables.

In the "System variables" section → find Path → click Edit.

Add this path (depending on your installation):

C:\mingw-w64\bin


(Make sure the path points to the bin folder where gcc.exe exists).

Click OK → close all dialogs.

✅ Step 3: Verify Installation

Open Command Prompt and type:

gcc --version


You should see version details like:

gcc (x86_64-win32-seh-rev0) 12.2.0

✅ Step 4: Compile and Run Your C Program

Now in VS Code terminal (or Command Prompt):

cd "h:\My Drive\Learning C\"
gcc HelloWorld.c -o HelloWorld.exe
HelloWorld.exe
