/*
    Linked lists function as an array that can grow and shrink as needed, from any point in the array.
    Each node has:
        1. Data (actual value)
        2. Pointer to the next node
    Linked lists have a few advantages over arrays:
        Items can be added or removed from the middle of the list
        There is no need to define an initial size
        Unlike arrays, linked lists donâ€™t store elements in contiguous memory.
    However, linked lists also have a few disadvantages:
        There is no "random" access. needs to be translated to the nth node for the access
        Dynamic memory allocation and pointers are required which increases complexity of code
        Linked lists have a much larger overhead over arrays.
